# LCARS

## WTF?

This is an repository for me to learn and experiment with web-dev technologies that I might need to know for other, actual projects. Practice makes perfect, that's what they say. Sometimes I might get a chance to apply things to real, ongoing projects, but in case I don't, I'm going to attempt to recreate one of my favorite computer interfaces. It's called [LCARS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS) and it was invented by the people who made _Star Trek_.

## Note

This is not a real application. It may not work on your browser and it most likely won't work on your phone. There may be a lot of crazy, experimental web tech in here (e.g. Flexbox) that are not compatible with whatever you're running. It will not display your files or run your operating system or skin your music player. The only goal I have is to (a) play with things and (b) at least create a viable screensaver of an LCARS display.
